This repository contains code for clustering text data into topics and an Obsidian vault of summaries of articles read regarding Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

Code Repository:

The clustering code can be used to group similar text documents together, which can be useful for tasks such as:

Topic discovery: Identifying the main topics discussed in a collection of text documents.
Document summarization: Generating a summary of a set of text documents by extracting the most important information from each document.
Text classification: Classifying text documents into different categories.

Obsidian Vault Repository :

This repository is intended to be a resource for anyone who is interested in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. These summaries are organized into different topics, which makes it easy to find the information you are looking for and can be used to learn about these topics, develop new NLP applications, and stay up-to-date on the latest research.

Usage:

To use the clustering code, simply clone the repository and run the provided script. The script will take a set of text documents as input and produce a set of clusters as output.

To use the Obsidian vault, simply clone the repository and open the Obsidian vault in Obsidian. You can then browse the summaries and learn about the different topics covered.

Contribution:

This repository is open source and contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and add your own code or summaries.
